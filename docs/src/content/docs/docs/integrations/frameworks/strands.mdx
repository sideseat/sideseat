description: Integrate SideSeat with Strands Agents for live run visibility and debugging.

import { Tabs, TabItem, Aside, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

[Strands Agents](https://strandsagents.com) is an AI agent framework developed by AWS. It has native OpenTelemetry support, making SideSeat integration seamless.

## Quick Start

<Steps>
1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install strands-agents sideseat
   # or
   uv add strands-agents sideseat
   ```

2. **Add telemetry**

   ```python
   from sideseat import SideSeat, Frameworks
   SideSeat(framework=Frameworks.Strands)

   from strands import Agent

   agent = Agent()
   response = agent("What is the capital of France?")
   print(response)
   ```

3. **View runs**

   Open [http://localhost:5388](http://localhost:5388) to see your runs.
</Steps>

## Without SideSeat SDK

Strands has its own telemetry class that's compatible with SideSeat:

```python
from strands.telemetry import StrandsTelemetry

telemetry = StrandsTelemetry()
telemetry.setup_otlp_exporter(
    endpoint="http://localhost:5388/otel/default/v1/traces"
)
```

<Aside type="note">
The SideSeat SDK includes additional features like binary data handling and framework auto-detection. Use it unless you need Strands-specific telemetry configuration.
</Aside>

## TypeScript

The Strands TypeScript SDK doesn't include native OpenTelemetry yet. Use the [SideSeat JavaScript SDK](/docs/sdks/javascript/) for tracing.

## What You'll See

SideSeat shows a trace timeline with:
- A parent span for the agent run
- Child spans for each LLM call with model, tokens, and cost
- Child spans for each tool execution with inputs and outputs

## Tools

Strands automatically traces tool calls. Define tools normally:

```python
from strands import Agent, tool

@tool
def get_weather(location: str) -> str:
    """Get weather for a location."""
    return f"Weather in {location}: Sunny, 72F"

agent = Agent(tools=[get_weather])
response = agent("What's the weather in Paris?")
```

## Sessions

Group related traces using trace attributes:

```python
agent = Agent(
    trace_attributes={
        "session.id": "conversation-123",
        "user.id": "user-456",
    }
)
```

These attributes appear in SideSeat and enable filtering. All turns with the same `session.id` are grouped under one session.
