Quick fixes for common issues with the local AI development workbench.

## Runs Not Appearing

1. **Confirm SideSeat is running** — you should see `Local: http://127.0.0.1:5388` in the terminal
2. **Check the OTLP endpoint** — default is `http://localhost:5388/otel/default/v1/traces`
3. **Flush before exit** — call `client.shutdown()` (Python) or `await shutdown()` (JavaScript) before the script exits

<Aside type="tip">
You can set `SIDESEAT_ENDPOINT` or the standard `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable to configure the endpoint. The OpenTelemetry variable takes precedence if both are set.
</Aside>

## Port Already in Use

If port 5388 is occupied:

```bash
sideseat --port 5390
```

Update your SDK/OTLP endpoint to match.

## Auth Issues

If the UI asks for a token or refuses to load:

- Open the **tokenized URL** printed at startup when auth is enabled
- Or disable auth locally: `sideseat --no-auth`

## Missing Tokens or Cost Data

- Ensure the model ID is captured in `gen_ai.request.model`
- Use a recognized provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Amazon Bedrock, Vertex, etc.)

## Missing Tool Calls

- Confirm your framework emits tool spans via OpenTelemetry
- Use the SideSeat SDK for best results with tool I/O normalization
